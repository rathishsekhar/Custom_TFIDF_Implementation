# Overview

This data science project focuses on implementing a customary TFIDF and comparing with the results of sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer module. Later attempt would be made to calculate max_features. This is similar to implementing max_features parameter within the TfidfVectorizer. The goal is to see how accurately we arrive at the feature vector values by inputting a corpus. 

# Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or later preferably
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries listed in requirements.txt

# Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

├── notebooks \
│─├── CountVectorizer.ipynb \
├── README.md \
├── requirements.txt \
└── LICENSE \


# Data
No external data has been used. A sentence corpus has been creted within the CountVectorize.ipynb and used. So all data will be found within the jupyter notebook

# Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Custom_TFIDF_Implementation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Custom_TFIDF_Implementation

3. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data:
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Explore the tasks:
jupyter notebook notebooks/CountVectorizer.ipynb

# Analysis



# Results

The project achieved the following results:

# Contributions
